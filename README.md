YAML Data Processing Experiment
This project demonstrates how to work with YAML files in Python, specifically focusing on processing student data. The application allows you to load student information from a YAML file, display all students, and filter them based on their GPA.

Project Structure
. ├── README.md ├── requirements.txt ├── students.yaml └── app.py

Components
1. students.yaml
Contains the student data in YAML format. Each student entry includes:

name: Student's name
age: Student's age
major: Field of study
gpa: Grade Point Average
Example: yaml students:

name: Alice age: 21 major: Computer Science gpa: 3.8
name: Bob age: 22 major: Mathematics gpa: 3.5
name: Charlie age: 20 major: Physics gpa: 3.9
name: David age: 23 major: Chemistry gpa: 3.2
name: Eva age: 21 major: Computer Science gpa: 3.7
2. app.py
The main Python script that processes the YAML data. It includes several functions:

load_data(file_path): Loads and parses the YAML file.
display_students(students): Displays information about all students.
filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa): Filters students based on minimum GPA.
main(): Orchestrates the program flow.
3. requirements.txt
Lists the project dependencies:

pyyaml==6.0.1

Setup and Installation
Clone or download this repository: sh git clone <repository_url> cd <repository_name>

Install the required dependencies: sh pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the application: sh python app.py

The program will:

Display all students and their information.
Prompt you to enter a minimum GPA value.
Show students who meet or exceed the specified GPA threshold.
Example Output
All Students: Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8 Name: Bob, Age: 22, Major: Mathematics, GPA: 3.5 Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9 Name: David, Age: 23, Major: Chemistry, GPA: 3.2 Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Enter minimum GPA to filter students: 3.6

Students with GPA >= 3.6: Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8 Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9 Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Features
YAML file parsing using PyYAML.
Student data management.
GPA-based filtering.
Clean and organized code structure.
Error handling for file operations.
Technical Details
Uses yaml.safe_load() for secure YAML parsing.
Student data is stored in a list of dictionaries.
GPA filtering is implemented using list comprehension.
Handles floating-point GPA values.
Notes
Ensure app.py and students.yaml are in the same directory.
The program expects valid YAML syntax in the input file.
GPA values should be numeric (floating-point numbers).
